      $ npm install -g karma@0.8.8
      $ brew install phantomjs

* How to run the test suite

`bundle exec rake`

* How to start up the dev env

      $ ln -s .env.development .env
      $ foreman start

* Deployment instructions

Coming soon. For now whenever a spec build passes an rpm should be built and installed.

* Gotchas
You'd think customer-service.systest.dbg.westfield.com and customer-service.uat.dbg.westfield.com are the urls for systest and uat.
You'd think wrong. These URLS don't provide browsers with access to the any services except indirectly.

For systest and uat, use the following URLS:
http://wwwau.systest.dbg.westfield.com/
and
http://www.uat.westfield.com.au/
