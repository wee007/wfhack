/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into styleguide.css, which will include all the files
 * that are imported below.
 *
 * application.css is imported via Base layout template so you shouldn't need to re-import
 * your application styles. Placholders, functions, mixins and variables however will need
 * to be re-imported here in order for Sass to compile them into styleguide.css

Style Guide stylesheet

  Note:
    All class names need to be prefixed with `sg-` so they're isolated to the 'Style
    Guide' pages only and don't conflict with the project styles.
