When entering Westfield shopping centres and car parks, customer's personal information and images may be collected by Westfield, and Westfield may collect customer's personal information and images from third parties (for example, the police or retailers). This information may be used by Westfield in connection with the management and security of the Westfield shopping centres and may be provided to law enforcement and government bodies, Westfield staff and subcontractors, insurers and retailers for those purposes.
