  title: Abstractions
  description: An abstraction is a CSS methodology that basically removes a pattern from a specific idea and makes a more generic idea out of it e.g. make a list render horizontally. They exist to avoid writing the same similar patterns over and over, instead create a single more generic representation of those patterns and reuse that instead.

  title: Grid
  description: A responsive grid used for the site structure and for any other layouts. The grid is fluid meaning it can easily resize itself to fit into different screen sizes and adjustments have been made using <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/mediaqueries" rel="external">CSS3 Media Queries</a> so the grid will fit nicely into smaller screen sizes.

#   title: Helpers
#   description: Helpers are a bunch of classes to apply very common styles to elements and modules e.g. make text right aligned, apply the base bottom margin to an element, etc. They're to be used arbitrarily i.e. only if an element/module doesn't already have a class to which you could apply this styling.
