It's basic signature is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nenquire.register(query /* string */, handler /* object || array  || function */);\n```\n\n`query` is the CSS media query you wish to respond to, and `handler` is an object containing any logic to handle the query. An example of usage is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nenquire.register(\"screen and (max-width:1000px)\", {\n\n    match : function() {},      // OPTIONAL\n                                // If supplied, triggered when the media query transitions \n                                // *from an unmatched to a matched state*\n\n    unmatch : function() {},    // OPTIONAL\n                                // If supplied, triggered when the media query transitions \n                                // *from a matched state to an unmatched state*.\n                                // Also may be called when handler is unregistered (if destroy is not available)\n\n    setup : function() {},      // OPTIONAL\n                                // If supplied, triggered once immediately upon registration of the handler\n\n    destroy : function() {},    // OPTIONAL\n                                // If supplied, triggered when handler is unregistered. Place cleanup code here\n\n    deferSetup : true           // OPTIONAL, defaults to false\n                                // If set to true, defers execution the setup function \n                                // until the media query is first matched. still triggered just once\n});\n```\n\nThis should be enough to get you going, but **please read the full [enquire.js documentation](http://wickynilliams.github.com/enquire.js/)** if you wish to learn about the other cool features.\n\n##Contributing\n\n* Got an awesome idea? \n* Found a *not-so*-awesome bug? \n* Wish to get my attention through an inappropriate communication channel?!\n\nThen please don't hesitate to raise an issue, they will *all* be looked at and tended to.\n\nAnd for all the cool cats who are prepared to give their time to contribute code, feel free to open a pull request. If you could write unit tests to accompany your pull request that would be pretty sweet, but no worries if not - if it's good enough to be merged in, it's good enough for me to spend a little time to write tests on your behalf :-)\n\n##License\n\nLicense: MIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n\n\n",
